First, run problem1.py to generate solution-problem-1.txt, which calculates the conservation rate at each position in the gapped alignment. Then, execute problem2.py to create solution-problem-2.pdf, which visualizes the smoothed conservation rates. Next, run problem3.py to produce solution-problem-3.txt, which identifies the variable regions. Finally, run problem4.py to generate solution-problem-4.pdf, which displays both the conservation rates and variable regions in a single visualization.
